            <h1> Statement of Signifigance </h1>

            <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows: </p>


            <ul>
                <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
            </ul>

Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use. </p>

            <p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles. </p>

            <p>Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission. </p>
